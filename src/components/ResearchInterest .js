                I believe that a physicist, or any scientist for that matter, will at some point in their research career need to, if necessary, step out of the comfort zone and look for solutions to a problem in any place possible. Keeping this spirt in my heart and mind, my research interests are rather broad. From among those, I am most interested in:

                1) Cosmology and Galaxy evolution
                2) Blackholes and Active Galactic Nuclei
                3) Non-linear Dynamics

                These interests are not just for theoretical study. I am also interested in their experimental, phenomenological and observational aspects.
